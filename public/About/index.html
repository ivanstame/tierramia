        <h3>Beginnings</h3>
        <p>Tierra Mia's story is one about coffee - naturally.  But it is also one about family, work ethic, and community. Long before our founder, Ulysses Romero, opened the first cafe doors in South Gate in 2008, he was carefully crafting our menu with the help of an espresso machine he set up in the family kitchen. </p>
        <p>His mother would help with the recipes and was always willing to lend her critique.  His father, co-founder of Romero's Food Products, remembers - "Sometimes she was already in bed and he'd come in to ask her to taste something.  He wants to make the best coffee he can".  This same hard work and dedication is what has helped Tierra Mia grow to now 20 stores across California in just twelve years.</p>

        <h3>The Difference</h3>
        <p>The welcoming environment we strive to create in our cafes, from the decor to the music, is meant to capture and evoke the Latin-American spirit.  Along with the beautiful surroundings you'll be served by some of the friendliest and highly trained baristas in California.  We train our staff to make everything from a classic pour over to a frappe and to do it all exceedinlgy well.  </p>
        <p>The quality provided by the skill of our staff is matched by the quality of the ingredients they work with everyday to create your favorite drinks and pastries.  Every bean in our coffees was roasted to perfection by our own Master Roasters and every delicious bite of our pastries was baked in our Lynwood bakery.  Our customers can taste the difference quality makes, so we go to great lengths to make sure you receive only the best, everytime.</p>

        <h3>Commitment</h3>
        <p>Finally, we believe strongly in supporting our communities in a multitude of ways.  With a staff of over 200, Tierra Mia is at the heart of the life of each neighborhood we serve.  We stand behind our commitment to work hard to provide opportunities for leadership and growth for everyone we employ.</p>

          <p>In addition to supporting our communities by providing quality career opportunities we also started the Tierra Mia Cares Foundation in 2015.  Partnered with Families With Schools, Tierra Mia Cares sponsors the "Read With Me" program for classrooms in South Gate, Lynwood, and Pico Rivera with the hopes to eventually have each Tierra Mia store be partnered with a specific school. </p><p>“It gives a deeper sense of meaning to the work we do. It is important to the culture of our company,” says Ulysses. “We care about the communities that allow us to exist.” </p>
